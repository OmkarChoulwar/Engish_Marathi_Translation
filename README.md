# Engish_Marathi_Translation
The language translation model implemented using Sequence to Sequence and Encoder-Decoder model
- The implementation is done using Character level encoding in order to achieve better translation based on words.
- Also LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)units are being used to maintain Semantics of the Sentences being translated so that the meaning remains the same even after the translation. 
- The more the data fed to the model the more the accurate it becomes in translating the sentences. Here is the small implementation of it where sentences are being translated from one language to another. 
- The same can be done for other languages as well.
